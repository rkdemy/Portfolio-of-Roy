            ChaseSpace â€” a platform that connects buyers and travelers globally.
            Travelers who are already travelling from one country to another can
            conveniently purchase products on behalf of buyers and deliver them.
          </div>

          <p>
            As a team we successfully implemented user roles (Buyers and
            Travelers), authentication, integrated transactions using Escrow,
            CRUD functionality for Travelers and Buyers, Real-time messaging,
            user reviews, user profiles and edited database design schema.

            The Goal
          </h1>

          <p>
            The Goal was to build a solid foundation for the application,
            setting the stage for future development and fine-tuning. It also
            allowed us to showcase our abilities in core feature implementation
            and teamwork, all while working within a real-world project.

            Project Overview

          <p>
            This 'Professional Experience' was a capstone unit at university
            where our team of four was assigned a client. ChaseSpace asked us to
            develop the core functionality of their mobile application before
            handing it off to a second development team.

            Key Involvements
          </h1>
          <h1>Authentication</h1>
          <p>
            Implemented the core authentication process, covering user
            registration and login functionalities, ensuring the privacy and
            integrity of user accounts.

          <h1>Real-time Messages</h1>
          <p>
            Implemented real-time messaging to enhance user interactions and
            communication within the platform. After discussing with our
            supervisor and client we agreed that using Firebase Real-time
            database was the best course of action for a startup rather than
            integrating a WebSocket and hosting it from scratch.

          <p>
            After the research phase I gained a clear app vision and the
            milestones the team would need to achieve. After a couple of weeks
            guiding the team I gradually became the project lead. I managed
            various aspects of the project from being primary contact for the
            client which included managing client expectations, addressing
            concerns, and ensuring client satisfaction. I also managed the
            timeline and supported the team with bugs, code, and Git assistance.

        <div>
          <h1>Adapting to existing database</h1>

          <p>
            Inheriting a Django and Python backend with limited documentation
            from the previous team was a challenge. Navigating their source
            code, deciphering the database structure, and understanding the use
            of each table required indepth analysis and adaptation.

        <div>
          <h1>Real-time messaging</h1>

          <p>
            Implementing real-time messaging per the client's request was a
            complex task. I researched whether to build this feature from
            scratch or use a third-party service like Firebase Real-time
            Database, opting for the latter due to cost-effectiveness for a
            startup. Implementing additional features like an unread badge,
            displaying the latest message, and enabling image uploads added
            further complexity.

        <div>
          <h1>Escrow API</h1>

          <p>
            Integrating the Escrow API presented the most significant challenge.
            With limited community support, forums, or resources, I relied
            heavily on the official API documentation. It took three days of
            trial and error to identify the correct code snippet and
            successfully integrate the API.

          <p>
            This professional experience was my first experience into client
            services, involving tasks such as expectation management, regular
            communication via emails and Zoom meetings, and collaboration within
            a team. The collaborative nature of discussing code, brainstorming
            ideas, and overcoming challenges as a group stood out as a
            significant reason for my enjoyment and reaffirmed my passion for
            the industry.
