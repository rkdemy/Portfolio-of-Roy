          The Problem

        <span>
          The exorbitant delivery costs associated with purchasing products from
          overseas, particularly in Australia. High delivery fees, which can
          sometimes be as expensive as the product itself or even more.

          E.g., Hedon a motorcycle helmet company places the shipping cost at

          The Solution
        </h1>
        <span>
          ChaseSpace â€” a platform that connects buyers and travelers globally.
          Travelers who are already travelling from one country to another can
          conveniently purchase products on behalf of buyers and deliver them.
        </span>

        <p>
          As a team we successfully implemented user roles (Buyers and
          Travelers), authentication, integrated transactions using Escrow, CRUD
          functionality for Travelers and Buyers, Real-time messaging, user
          reviews, user profiles and edited database design schema.

          The Goal

        <p>
          The Goal was to build a solid foundation for the application, setting
          the stage for future development and fine-tuning. It also allowed us
          to showcase our abilities in core feature implementation and teamwork,
          all while working within a real-world project.

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>

        <p>
          This 'Professional Experience' was a capstone unit at university where
          our team of four was assigned a client. ChaseSpace asked us to develop
          the core functionality of their mobile application before handing it
          off to a second development team.

          Implemented real-time messaging to enhance user interactions and
          communication within the platform. After discussing with our
          supervisor and client we agreed that using Firebase Real-time database
          was the best course of action for a startup rather than integrating a
          WebSocket and hosting it from scratch.

        <p>
          After the research phase I gained a clear app vision and the
          milestones the team would need to achieve. After a couple of weeks
          guiding the team I gradually became the project lead. I managed
          various aspects of the project from being primary contact for the
          client which included managing client expectations, addressing
          concerns, and ensuring client satisfaction. I also managed the
          timeline and supported the team with bugs, code, and Git assistance.

        <h1>Adapting to existing database</h1>

        <p>
          Inheriting a Django and Python backend with limited documentation from
          the previous team was a challenge. Navigating their source code,
          deciphering the database structure, and understanding the use of each
          table required indepth analysis and adaptation.

      <div>
        <h1>Real-time messaging</h1>

        <p>
          Implementing real-time messaging per the client's request was a
          complex task. I researched whether to build this feature from scratch
          or use a third-party service like Firebase Real-time Database, opting
          for the latter due to cost-effectiveness for a startup. Implementing
          additional features like an unread badge, displaying the latest
          message, and enabling image uploads added further complexity.

      <div>
        <h1>Escrow API</h1>

        <p>
          Integrating the Escrow API presented the most significant challenge.
          With limited community support, forums, or resources, I relied heavily
          on the official API documentation. It took three days of trial and
          error to identify the correct code snippet and successfully integrate
          the API.

        <h1>Conclusion & Reflection</h1>

        <p>
          This professional experience was my first experience into client
          services, involving tasks such as expectation management, regular
          communication via emails and Zoom meetings, and collaboration within a
          team. The collaborative nature of discussing code, brainstorming
          ideas, and overcoming challenges as a group stood out as a significant
          reason for my enjoyment and reaffirmed my passion for the industry.
